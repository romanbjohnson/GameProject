# GameProject

Day 1

This is the first commit to the Space History Jeopardy Game. This idea first came to me because I realized I've never seen a jeopardy game focused on space history. The space industry is an industry highly built by technology.

Day 2 

Because of this, I think it very important to highlight some of the technological contributions of technologists to the space industry including software engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers. This game will have a simple interface and include a two-player role gaming interface as well. The homepage will be the base of where nearly as the questions come to. When one player picks one question, it will make a "room create eventID" that will be equal to the amount of questions that each question has. I will only want two players to join one room. Every question will be attached to four answers of which only one answer will be correct. I will be using the both the FOR LOOP and IF ELSE statements in Javascript to achieve this goal.

In terms of the software programming we will be including in this project, we will be using HTML programming, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and Javascript. We will be planning the layout of the website using this concept called wireframing. Because we will be designing this game in a tabular format, we will be creating a main divider (div) that we are called "app" and each category will have their own dividers as well. The five categories are the following: "who, what, why, when, and where." I have chosen this simple layout for its simplicity and easy-to-understand layout for coders who will look at my code in the future so they can improve their coding skills and also learn from this project. As I was saying above, the design of this game will be in a tabular format with a click function for each "square" (divider name for the question itself). In building this game, one of the objects is to use a strategy called dom manipuatlion which refers to a method where you are retreiving elements from a document that you have access to. I will be using the Javascript popup Box function to alert Player 1 and Player 2

Day 3 

Today, I'm thinking through the elements of DOM (document object model) manipulation I will need to employ to plan how I will design (wireframing) the app I am calling the Space History Jeopardy game. First, before I design the website, I need to think through the steps of the website design. I know I'll need a background image that represents space. The second thing I will need is an animation of a space rocket or some similar animation. Because we are using dom manipulation and we want to make the game in a series of blocks that are called dividers (divs) in the website creation world, we will also need to use element functions and also the span tag function to put text within our HTML blocks (dividers). According to the programming website, WW2 Schools, the span tag can be used to  "mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document" and can be "easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute" and it is "much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is a n inline element. We will also be using the Javascript (js) method called querySelector. According to Mozilla developer website, the querySelector method in DOM manipulation allows the developer to The Document method querySelector() returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selectors. If no matches are found, null is returned.
