# GameProject

Day 1

This is the first commit to the Space History Jeopardy Game. This idea first came to me because I realized I've never seen a jeopardy game focused on space history. The space industry is an industry highly built by technology.

Day 2 

Because of this, I think it very important to highlight some of the technological contributions of technologists to the space industry including software engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers. This game will have a simple interface and include a two-player role gaming interface as well.
