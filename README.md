# GameProject

Day 1

This is the first commit to the Space History Jeopardy Game. This idea first came to me because I realized I've never seen a jeopardy game focused on space history. The space industry is an industry highly built by technology.

Day 2 

Because of this, I think it very important to highlight some of the technological contributions of technologists to the space industry including software engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers. This game will have a simple interface and include a two-player role gaming interface as well.

In terms of the software programming we will be including in this project, we will be using HTML programming, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and Javascript. We will be planning the layout of the website using this concept called wireframing. Because we will be designing this game in a tabular format, we will be creating a main divider (div) that we are called "app" and each category will have their own dividers as well. The five categories are the following: "who, what, why, when, and where." I have chosen this simple layout for its simplicity and easy-to-understand layout for coders who will look at my code in the future so they can improve their coding skills and also learn from this project.
